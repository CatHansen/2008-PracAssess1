## What is the Splash Tasks app?

Splash Tasks is a basic to-do list app that currently only has the functionality to display a to-do list from a json file, but the developer is working on functionality to add, delete and edit the tasks.

## Note to Jim:

I committed once after midnight becasue i realized five minutes too late that although i remembered to change my user name and repo name to lowercase i didn't change my page names... I'm super sorry if that is a problem and please feel free to check my commits that this is all I did and I totally understand if you need to remove marks for this.


## For developer:
* add a favicon
* make it not look so bad
* delete 
* add 
* edit
